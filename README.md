# KRAS-RIT1-profiling

This repository contains the code used to process and analyze the data for the KRAS and RIT1 profiling project (Lo et al., *in revision*). It includes the pipeline for RNA-seq read alignment and transcript quantification, as well as analyses of differential expression. It also includes some analysis of the proteomic and phosphoproteomic datasets and re-analysis of L1000 data of the same genes in a separate screen (Berger et al., *2016*).
